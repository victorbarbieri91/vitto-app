Para clientes de outros estados, programamos rotas de coleta junto às entregas regulares, otimizando o transporte e reduzindo custos operacionais.

Em estados onde há maior acúmulo de créditos sem aproveitamento imediato, a empresa avalia medidas administrativas ou judiciais para viabilizar a utilização dos valores.

13	A tese da exclusão do ICMS e de PIS/COFINS da base de cálculo do IPI propõe que esses tributos não devem integrar o cálculo do IPI, argumentando que não compõem o valor da operação, base deste imposto. Fundamentada no artigo 155, §2º, inciso XI, da Constituição Federal, e no artigo 46, parágrafo único, do Código Tributário Nacional, a tese impacta principalmente o ICMS, PIS/COFINS e IPI.\n\nApesar de existirem jurisprudências divergentes, o STF e STJ ainda não consolidaram um entendimento sobre a matéria. A Receita Federal e o Fisco discordam da tese, havendo risco de autuações para empresas que adotarem essa posição. Empresas que realizam vendas de produtos sujeitos ao IPI, especialmente nos setores de Indústria, Comércio e Serviços, e que estejam no Lucro Presumido ou Lucro Real, podem se beneficiar da aplicação dessa tese. \n\nA legislação permite a recuperação de tributos indevidamente pagos nos últimos 5 anos. Atualmente, a tese encontra-se em análise, sem uma jurisprudência consolidada. Para empresas interessadas em contestar a inclusão do ICMS e PIS/COFINS na base do IPI, é essencial que tenham um controle efetivo dos valores pagos e estejam dispostas a lidar com eventuais autuações

15	A tese da Cobrança Antecipada de ICMS nas Operações Interestaduais questiona a legalidade da antecipação do ICMS pelo estado de destino em operações entre diferentes estados. Essa prática é vista como onerosa para empresas do Comércio, Indústria e Serviços, que precisam arcar com o pagamento do imposto antes do momento devido. A base legal para esse debate está na Constituição Federal, especialmente no artigo 155, inciso II, parágrafo 2º, incisos VII e VIII, que regulamenta a incidência do ICMS em operações interestaduais.\n\nApesar da justificativa do Fisco de que a antecipação é necessária para prevenir a evasão fiscal, há jurisprudências divergentes sobre o tema, sem um entendimento consolidado pelo STF. Empresas enquadradas no Lucro Presumido, Lucro Real ou Simples Nacional estão sujeitas a autuações e penalidades se não cumprirem com essa antecipação. A recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos é permitida pela legislação.\n\nAtualmente, a tese está em análise, com decisões judiciais conflitantes. Perguntas relevantes que podem surgir são se a empresa realiza operações interestaduais, se já foi autuada por não antecipar o ICMS, se tem controle sobre os impostos pagos nos últimos 5 anos e se está disposta a entrar com uma ação judicial para questionar essa cobrança antecipada.

9	A tese tributária em destaque aborda a exclusão do ICMS da base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, argumentando que esse valor não integra o faturamento/receita bruta das empresas. Essa discussão tem relevância tanto jurídica quanto fiscal, pois pode resultar na redução da carga tributária das empresas. \n\nOs tributos envolvidos nessa tese são o ICMS, o PIS e a COFINS. A base legal para essa discussão inclui dispositivos da Constituição Federal, assim como as Leis nº 9.718/98, 10.637/02 e 10.833/03.\n\nNo âmbito da fiscalização, a Receita Federal posiciona-se a favor da inclusão do ICMS na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, podendo autuar as empresas que excluírem esse valor sem respaldo judicial ou administrativo.\n\nA jurisprudência do STF reconheceu a inconstitucionalidade da inclusão do ICMS na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, enquanto o STJ definiu que o ICMS a ser excluído é o destacado na nota fiscal.\n\nEssa discussão possui retroação de até 5 anos, conforme o art. 168 do CTN. Atualmente, a jurisprudência consolidada no STF é favorável ao contribuinte, porém ainda há debate quanto ao valor do ICMS a ser excluído.\n\nEmpresas enquadradas nos regimes de Lucro Presumido e Lucro Real nos setores de serviços, indústria e comércio são impactadas por essa tese. Questões relevantes a serem consideradas incluem a condição de contribuinte de ICMS, recolhimento de PIS e COFINS, existência de processos judiciais/administrativos sobre a exclusão do ICMS e levantamento dos valores passiveis de recuperação.\n\nEssa tese apresenta uma oportunidade tributária significativa para empresas que buscam regularizar sua situação fiscal e reduzir sua carga

10	A tese tributária em questão discute a inclusão do Imposto Sobre Serviços (ISS) na base de cálculo do Programa de Integração Social (PIS) e da Contribuição para o Financiamento da Seguridade Social (COFINS). A argumentação se baseia na não inclusão do ISS na receita bruta das empresas, defendendo que não deve compor a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS. \n\nOs principais marcos legais envolvidos são a Constituição Federal, Lei 9.718/98 e Lei Complementar 116/03. A Receita Federal adota o entendimento de que o ISS integra a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, o que gera riscos de autuação, conforme a Solução de Consulta COSIT nº 99/2017.\n\nApesar da ausência de uma decisão final do Supremo Tribunal Federal, há jurisprudências favoráveis aos contribuintes em instâncias inferiores, como nos Tribunais Regionais Federais e no Superior Tribunal de Justiça (REsp 1.517.492/PR). A legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.\n\nAs perguntas relevantes a serem consideradas incluem o pagamento de ISS pela empresa, o regime tributário em que ela se enquadra (Lucro Real ou Lucro Presumido), a existência de processos discutindo a inclusão do ISS na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, o controle dos valores de ISS pagos nos últimos 5 anos e a presença de planejamento tributário relacionado ao PIS e à COFINS.\n\nOs regimes tributários aplicáveis são o Lucro Presumido e o Lucro Real, abrangendo setores econômicos como a Indústria, Serviços e Comércio.

11	A tese tributária do PIS COFINS na própria Base debate a exclusão do valor do PIS (Programa de Integração Social) e da COFINS (Contribuição para o Financiamento da Seguridade Social) da base de cálculo dessas contribuições. A argumentação central é que a inclusão desses tributos resulta em bitributação, indo de encontro ao princípio da não cumulatividade. A base legal dessa tese está fundamentada no artigo 195 da Constituição Federal, na Lei nº 9.718/98, e nas Leis nº 10.637/02 e 10.833/03, que tratam da não cumulatividade do PIS/COFINS.\n\nExistem divergências entre os tribunais superiores sobre o assunto. O Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) apresenta decisões favoráveis à exclusão do PIS COFINS da base, enquanto o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) se posiciona de forma contrária. A questão ainda aguarda julgamento definitivo no STF, o que gera incertezas sobre a sua aplicação.\n\nA Receita Federal contesta essa tese, defendendo a inclusão do PIS e da COFINS na própria base de cálculo. O risco de autuação é elevado para empresas que adotam essa tese sem respaldo judicial favorável. A legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.\n\nA análise da tese é relevante para empresas no regime de não cumulatividade do PIS/COFINS, atuantes nos setores de Comércio, Indústria e Serviços. As empresas precisam considerar se estão dispostas a se expor ao risco de autuação fiscal, levando em conta sua gestão fiscal e contábil. Além disso, a aplicação dessa tese varia de acordo com o regime tributário adotado, podendo ser relevante para empresas enquadradas no Lucro Presumido ou Lucro Real.

12	A tese tributária do ICMS-ST na base do PIS COFINS argumenta que o valor do ICMS Substituição Tributária não deve integrar a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, uma vez que não se incorpora ao patrimônio do contribuinte, sendo apenas um ingresso de caixa. Essa tese se fundamenta na Constituição Federal, nos artigos 155 e 195, bem como nas Leis nº 10.637/2002 e 10.833/2003, que regulamentam o PIS e a COFINS. \n\nApesar de a Receita Federal e o Fisco contestarem essa interpretação, existem decisões administrativas favoráveis aos contribuintes, incluindo posicionamentos do STJ. Contudo, a questão ainda não foi analisada pelo STF. A aplicação da tese possibilita a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.\n\nA análise dessa tese é importante para empresas que atuam nos setores de Comércio, Indústria e Serviços, sob os regimes tributários de Lucro Real e Lucro Presumido. Questões relevantes a serem consideradas incluem se a empresa realiza operações com mercadorias sujeitas ao regime de substituição tributária do ICMS, se é optante pelo Simples Nacional, se já foi autuada por incluir o ICMS-ST na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, se já ajuizou ação judicial para excluir esse valor das bases de cálculo e se possui operações interestaduais.\n\nAtualmente, a tese encontra-se em análise, com algumas decisões judiciais e administrativas favoráveis ao contribuinte, mas ainda sem posicionamento definitivo do STF.É essencial para as empresas avaliarem essa

16	A tese tributária intitulada "INSS sobre as Verbas Indenizatórias" analisa a questão da incidência da contribuição previdenciária patronal sobre verbas de caráter indenizatório, como aviso prévio indenizado, indenização do artigo 479 da CLT e terço constitucional de férias. A discussão se mantém relevante devido à possibilidade de redução da carga tributária das empresas, ao se argumentar que tais verbas não integram o salário de contribuição.\n\n### Contexto Legal e Jurisprudencial\nA base legal para essa discussão inclui dispositivos da Constituição Federal (artigos 195 e 201), da Lei nº 8.212/1991 (artigos 22 e 28), do Decreto nº 3.048/1999 (artigos 214 e 220) e da CLT (artigos 457 e 479). Enquanto o Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) decidiu pela não incidência da contribuição previdenciária sobre verbas indenizatórias no julgamento do REsp 1.230.957, o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) reconheceu a repercussão geral da questão, mas ainda aguarda julgamento no RE 878.694.\n\n### Fiscalização e Recuperação de Tributos\nHá riscos de autuação por parte da Receita Federal e do Fisco, que entendem que as verbas indenizatórias devem compor a base de cálculo da contribuição previdenciária. No entanto, a legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos cinco anos, o que pode representar uma oportunidade para empresas que se enquadram nessa situação.\n\n### Aplicabilidade e Setores Econômicos\nEmpresas que atuam sob os regimes de Lucro Presumido, Lucro Real ou Simples Nacional podem se beneficiar da análise dessa tese tributária. Os setores econômicos impactados incluem comércio, indústria e serviços.\n\n### Status e Perguntas Relevantes\nA tese encontra-se em análise, com posicionamento favorável do STJ, aguardando pronunciamento do STF. Perguntas relevantes a considerar incluem a frequência de pagamentos de verbas indenizatórias pela empresa, o recolhimento de INSS sobre essas verbas, autuações passadas, controle dos valores pagos nos últimos cinco anos e acompanhamento dos julgamentos relacionados ao tema. \n\nEste texto serve como referência para empresas que buscam compreender as possíveis aplicações da tese sobre a

A equipe fiscal acompanha mensalmente os créditos acumulados, especialmente nas operações interestaduais, e verifica a possibilidade de compensação interna ou aproveitamento em períodos futuros. Em estados onde há maior acúmulo de créditos sem aproveitamento imediato, a empresa avalia medidas administrativas ou judiciais para viabilizar a utilização dos valores. Além disso, mantemos relatórios analíticos e conciliações periódicas para garantir conformidade e rastreabilidade em caso de fiscalização.\n\nAntes de cada operação, nossa equipe fiscal verifica se o produto está sujeito ao regime de substituição tributária no estado de destino e, quando aplicável, realiza o recolhimento antecipado do ICMS-ST por meio de GNRE.\n\nA Distribuidora de Bebidas TM LTDA adota um modelo de logística reversa estruturada para as embalagens retornáveis, especialmente em operações interestaduais. Nas vendas que envolvem garrafas retornáveis ou engradados, mantemos um controle por cliente e por nota fiscal, registrando a quantidade de vasilhames enviados e o compromisso de devolução. Para clientes de outros estados, programamos rotas de coleta junto às entregas regulares, otimizando o transporte e reduzindo custos operacionais. Além disso, contamos com depósitos regionais parceiros, que servem como pontos de apoio logístico para armazenagem e retorno das embalagens. Essa estrutura permite garantir a rastreabilidade, atender à legislação ambiental e evitar perdas financeiras com embalagens não devolvidas.\n\nsegue o mesmo processo\n\nNas operações interestaduais com embalagens não retornáveis, como caixas de papelão, shrink, garrafas plásticas e latas, a Distribuidora de Bebidas TM LTDA adota práticas voltadas à logística reversa indireta, conforme as diretrizes da Política Nacional de Resíduos Sólidos (PNRS). Embora essas embalagens não retornem fisicamente à empresa, mantemos parceria com cooperativas e operadores logísticos especializados para comprovar a destinação adequada dos resíduos gerados. Também participamos de programas de compensação ambiental em conjunto com fabricantes, contribuindo para o cumprimento das metas estaduais e federais de recolhimento. Internamente, mantemos registros e relatórios gerenciais que documentam essas ações, o que nos permite atender exigências legais e demonstrar compromisso ambiental perante clientes e órgãos fiscalizadores.\n\nA Distribuidora de Bebidas TM LTDA realiza a gestão dos créditos de ICMS provenientes de operações interestaduais com produtos sujeitos à substituição tributária de forma cuidadosa e preventiva.

2	2025-04-07 20:05:09+00	ISS na base de cálculo do PIS COFINS	A tese tributária do ISS na base de cálculo do PIS COFINS discute se o valor do ISS deve ser incluído na base de cálculo dessas contribuições. A tese defende que o ISS não compõe a receita bruta das empresas, portanto, não deve integrar a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS.	PIS e COFINS	Constituição Federal, artigo 195; Lei 9.718/98, artigos 2 e 3; Lei Complementar 116/03, artigo 1.	A Receita Federal entende que o ISS integra a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, portanto, há risco de autuação. A Solução de Consulta COSIT nº 99/2017 apresenta esse entendimento.	Há decisões favoráveis ao contribuinte nos Tribunais Regionais Federais e no Superior Tribunal de Justiça (REsp 1.517.492/PR). O Supremo Tribunal Federal ainda não se manifestou de forma definitiva.	A legislação permite recuperar tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.	Em análise. Ainda não há decisão definitiva do STF, mas existem decisões favoráveis em instâncias inferiores.	{"Sua empresa paga ISS?","Sua empresa está no regime de Lucro Real ou Lucro Presumido?","Sua empresa tem processos administrativos ou judiciais discutindo a inclusão do ISS na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS?","Sua empresa tem controle dos valores de ISS pagos nos últimos 5 anos?","Sua empresa tem algum planejamento tributário voltado para o PIS e a COFINS?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real"}	{Indústria,Serviços,Comércio}	{"Empresa presta serviços sujeitos ao ISS","ISS é destacado separadamente nas notas fiscais de serviço","Empresa é contribuinte do PIS/COFINS no regime não-cumulativo","Atividade principal é prestação de serviços","Valores de ISS representam parcela significativa da receita de serviços"}
5	2025-04-07 20:05:17+00	Exclusão do ICMS e de PIS/COFINS da base do IPI	A tese propõe a exclusão do ICMS e de PIS/COFINS da base de cálculo do IPI, argumentando que esses tributos não compõem o valor da operação, base de cálculo do IPI, e assim, não devem integrar sua base de cálculo.	PIS e COFINS	A tese é fundamentada na interpretação do artigo 155, §2º, inciso XI, da Constituição Federal, e do artigo 46, parágrafo único, do Código Tributário Nacional.	A Receita Federal e o Fisco posicionam-se contrários à tese, havendo risco de autuações. Para esses órgãos, o ICMS e PIS/COFINS fazem parte da base de cálculo do IPI.	Existem decisões judiciais e administrativas divergentes. O STF e STJ ainda não possuem um posicionamento consolidado sobre a tese.	A legislação permite recuperar tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.	Em análise. Ainda não há jurisprudência consolidada sobre a tese.	{"A empresa realiza operações de vendas de produtos sujeitos ao IPI?","A empresa está no regime do Lucro Presumido ou Lucro Real?","A empresa tem contestado judicialmente a inclusão do ICMS e PIS/COFINS na base de cálculo do IPI?","A empresa tem um controle efetivo dos valores de ICMS, PIS/COFINS e IPI pagos nos últimos 5 anos?","A empresa está disposta a enfrentar possíveis autuações fiscais em decorrência do questionamento dessa tese?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real"}	{Indústria,Comércio,Serviços}	{"Empresa realiza operações de venda de produtos sujeitos ao IPI","ICMS e PIS/COFINS são destacados separadamente nas notas fiscais","Empresa recolhe IPI regularmente sobre produtos industrializados","Possui controle dos tributos que compõem o preço dos produtos","Operações com produtos tributados pelo IPI são regulares e significativas"}
3	2025-04-07 20:05:15+00	PIS COFINS na própria Base	A tese tributária do PIS COFINS na própria Base discute a possibilidade de exclusão do valor do PIS e da COFINS da própria base de cálculo dessas contribuições, argumentando que a inclusão do valor desses tributos na base de cálculo resulta em uma bitributação.	PIS e COFINS	A tese é fundamentada no artigo 195 da Constituição Federal, além da Lei nº 9.718/98 e a Lei nº 10.637/02 e 10.833/03 que tratam sobre a não cumulatividade do PIS/COFINS.	A Receita Federal contesta essa tese e tem o entendimento de que o PIS e a COFINS devem ser incluídos na própria base de cálculo. O risco de autuação é alto caso a empresa adote essa tese sem uma decisão judicial favorável.	Existe uma divergência entre os tribunais superiores. Enquanto o STJ tem decisões favoráveis a exclusão do PIS COFINS da base, o STF tem decisões contrárias. A questão ainda aguarda julgamento definitivo no STF.	A legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.	Em análise, aguardando julgamento definitivo no STF.	{"A empresa está no regime de não cumulatividade do PIS/COFINS?","A empresa tem operações de venda que são tributadas pelo PIS e COFINS?","A empresa já foi autuada pela Receita Federal por excluir o PIS e COFINS da base de cálculo?","A empresa está disposta a correr o risco de autuação fiscal para adotar essa tese?","A empresa tem uma boa gestão fiscal e contábil para suportar a adoção dessa tese?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real"}	{Comércio,Indústria,Serviços}	{"Empresa é contribuinte do PIS/COFINS no regime não-cumulativo","Empresa calcula PIS/COFINS sobre receita bruta incluindo o próprio valor desses tributos","Possui controle detalhado dos valores de PIS/COFINS recolhidos","Faturamento anual justifica o benefício fiscal","Empresa tem margens operacionais que seriam impactadas pela redução"}
4	2025-04-07 20:05:13+00	ICMS-ST na base do PIS COFINS	A tese tributária do ICMS-ST na base do PIS COFINS defende que o valor do ICMS Substituição Tributária não deve compor a base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, pois não se incorpora ao patrimônio do contribuinte, mas é mero ingresso de caixa.	ICMS-ST	A base legal da tese se encontra na Constituição Federal, artigos 155 e 195, e nas Leis nº 10.637/2002 e 10.833/2003 que regulamentam o PIS e a COFINS, respectivamente.	A Receita Federal e o Fisco contestam essa tese, aumentando os riscos de autuações. No entanto, existem decisões administrativas favoráveis ao contribuinte.	Existem decisões do STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça) favoráveis à exclusão do ICMS-ST da base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS. Entretanto, a questão ainda não foi analisada pelo STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal).	Segundo a legislação, a tese permite recuperar tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.	Em análise, com algumas decisões judiciais e administrativas favoráveis ao contribuinte.	{"A empresa realiza operações com mercadorias sujeitas ao regime de substituição tributária do ICMS?","A empresa é optante pelo Simples Nacional?","A empresa foi autuada por incluir o ICMS-ST na base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS?","A empresa já ajuizou ação judicial para excluir o ICMS-ST da base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS?","A empresa possui operações interestaduais?"}	{"Lucro Real","Lucro Presumido"}	{Comércio,Indústria,Serviços}	{"Empresa realiza operações com mercadorias sujeitas ao regime de substituição tributária","ICMS-ST é recolhido antecipadamente nas operações","ICMS-ST é destacado separadamente nas notas fiscais","Empresa é contribuinte do PIS/COFINS no regime não-cumulativo","Valores de ICMS-ST são relevantes no contexto do faturamento"}
7	2025-04-07 20:05:20+00	INSS sobre as Verbas Indenizatórias	A tese tributária 'INSS sobre as Verbas Indenizatórias' debate a incidência da contribuição previdenciária patronal sobre verbas de natureza indenizatória, como o aviso prévio indenizado, a indenização do artigo 479 da CLT e o terço constitucional de férias. A relevância dessa tese está na possibilidade de redução da carga tributária das empresas, ao entender que tais verbas não são parte do salário de contribuição.	INSS	Constituição Federal, artigos 195 e 201; Lei nº 8.212/1991, artigos 22 e 28; Decreto nº 3.048/1999, artigos 214 e 220; CLT, artigos 457 e 479.	A Receita Federal do Brasil e o Fisco entendem que as verbas indenizatórias compõem a base de cálculo para a contribuição previdenciária patronal. Existe risco de autuação em caso de não recolhimento.	O STJ, no julgamento do REsp 1.230.957, decidiu pela não incidência de contribuição previdenciária sobre verbas indenizatórias. No entanto, o STF, através do RE 878.694, reconheceu a repercussão geral da questão, ainda pendente de julgamento.	A legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos cinco anos.	Em análise, com entendimento favorável por parte do STJ, mas aguardando decisão do STF.	{"Sua empresa efetua regularmente pagamentos de verbas indenizatórias?","Sua empresa recolhe INSS sobre essas verbas?","A empresa já sofreu autuação por parte do Fisco sobre esse tema?","A empresa tem controle dos valores pagos a título de verbas indenizatórias nos últimos cinco anos?","A empresa tem acompanhado os julgamentos sobre essa tese?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real","Simples Nacional"}	{Comércio,Indústria,Serviços}	{"Empresa possui empregados e realiza pagamentos trabalhistas","Paga verbas indenizatórias como aviso prévio indenizado e férias proporcionais","Recolhe INSS patronal sobre essas verbas indenizatórias","Folha de pagamento possui valores significativos de verbas indenizatórias","Rotatividade de empregados gera verbas indenizatórias recorrentes"}
1	2025-04-07 20:05:06+00	ICMS na base de cálculo do PIS COFINS	A tese tributária do ICMS na base do PIS COFINS discute a exclusão do valor do ICMS destacado na nota fiscal da base de cálculo do PIS e da COFINS, argumentando que esse valor não compõe o faturamento/receita bruta das empresas. A relevância jurídica e fiscal se dá pela possibilidade de redução da carga tributária das empresas.	PIS e COFINS	Constituição Federal (art. 195, I, b), Lei nº 9.718/98 (art. 3º), Lei nº 9.718/98 (art. 3º, § 2º, I), Lei nº 10.637/02 (art. 1º), Lei nº 10.833/03 (art. 1º).	A Receita Federal defende a inclusão do ICMS na base de cálculo do PIS e COFINS. Há risco de autuação caso a empresa exclua o ICMS da base de cálculo sem respaldo judicial ou administrativo. Solução de Consulta Cosit nº 13/2018.	STF, julgamento do RE 574706 em 15/03/2017, reconheceu a inconstitucionalidade da inclusão do ICMS na base de cálculo do PIS e COFINS. STJ, julgamento do REsp 1.221.170/PR em 22/02/2018, decidiu que o ICMS a ser excluído é o destacado na nota fiscal.	5 anos, de acordo com o art. 168 do CTN.	Jurisprudência consolidada no STF favorável ao contribuinte, mas ainda em discussão quanto ao valor do ICMS a ser excluído.	{"Sua empresa é contribuinte de ICMS?","Sua empresa está no regime de Lucro Presumido ou Lucro Real?","Sua empresa recolhe PIS e COFINS?","Há algum processo judicial ou administrativo em curso sobre a exclusão do ICMS da base do PIS/COFINS?","Sua empresa já fez algum levantamento dos valores que poderiam ser recuperados?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real"}	{Serviços,Indústria,Comércio}	{"Empresa é contribuinte do PIS/COFINS no regime não-cumulativo","ICMS é destacado separadamente nas notas fiscais de venda","Empresa tem controle detalhado dos valores de ICMS recolhidos mensalmente","Operações envolvem venda de mercadorias sujeitas ao ICMS","Valores de ICMS representam parcela significativa do faturamento"}
6	2025-04-07 20:05:18+00	Cobrança antecipada de ICMS nas operações interestaduais	A tese da Cobrança antecipada de ICMS nas operações interestaduais se refere ao questionamento da legalidade da cobrança antecipada do ICMS (Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) pelo estado de destino em operações interestaduais. Essa prática é vista como onerosa para muitas empresas, que precisam arcar com o pagamento do imposto antes do devido momento.	ICMS	A principal base legal desta tese é a Constituição Federal, em especial o artigo 155, inciso II, parágrafo 2º, incisos VII e VIII, que regulamenta a incidência do ICMS em operações interestaduais.	O Fisco defende a legalidade da cobrança antecipada do ICMS, argumentando que ela é necessária para evitar a evasão fiscal. Contudo, há risco de autuações e penalidades para empresas que não cumprem com esta antecipação.	Há decisões divergentes sobre este tema. Alguns tribunais têm entendido que a cobrança antecipada de ICMS é inconstitucional, enquanto outros defendem sua legalidade. O STF ainda não consolidou seu entendimento sobre esta questão.	A legislação permite a recuperação de tributos pagos indevidamente nos últimos 5 anos.	Em análise, com decisões judiciais divergentes.	{"Sua empresa realiza operações interestaduais?","Seu regime tributário é o Lucro Real ou Lucro Presumido?","Sua empresa já foi autuada por não antecipar o ICMS?","Você tem controle sobre os impostos pagos nos últimos 5 anos?","Sua empresa está disposta a entrar com uma ação judicial para questionar a cobrança antecipada de ICMS?"}	{"Lucro Presumido","Lucro Real","Simples Nacional"}	{Comércio,Indústria,Serviços}	{"Empresa realiza operações interestaduais de venda de mercadorias","Recolhe antecipação de ICMS nas vendas para outros estados","Possui controle das antecipações de ICMS recolhidas","Operações interestaduais representam parcela significativa do faturamento","Volume de antecipações é materialmente relevante"}
